# Unit 1 - Reflections: Programming in Python

### Purpose of this page:
We have completed half of a semester in Python Programming and are reflecting on the scripting basics that we have just learned.  The below comments are specific to me.

### Overall reaction to Python computing:
I find python to be an incredibly forgiving scripting language. I have scripted in other formats such as: batch, bash, lotuscript, and javascript(with ajax), but the python environment has a faster learning curve and allows the coder to be a minimalist.    

### Ah-ha moments:
**Scripting languages use different techniques.  Below are some highlights of useful Python features:**
- #### The colon is your friend
	With any kind of loop or function definition, a colon (:) is needed to indicate that some decision making logic is about to follow.  As a python coder, if in doubt, remember you need to add a colon.  When the py source code is compiled, the runtime complier will let you know if the colon makes sense.
- #### Semi-colons at the end of sentences are overrated
	If you have ever coded in C#, you will be thrilled to know that in Python scripting, a semi-colon is not used at the end of a line.  It is like having Christmas all year long.  No need to search for missing semi-colons in your code.
- #### Indents are sensitive
	***Don't panic when you get a compile error.  50% of the time it is an extra space after an indentation.***
- #### Numeric commas can't be taken for granted
	Handling commas in number values
	<br/>print (format(42500, ",d"))
- #### "While True" is a nice automatic loop
	Simple way to stay in a loop until validation passes)
- #### Built-In modules are timesavers
	max(mylist, key=len)
- #### Quickly changing lists into strings and vice versa
	The expression "".join(x)    Allows one to quickly turn a list "x" into a string
	<br/>The expression x.split    Allows one to quickly turn a string "x" into a list

### Useful modules to import into code:
- #### random
	For ability to randomly generate 1 or 0, which can be a yes/no 
	Randomly generate...
- #### getpass
	Extremely important to hide a user's input when they are typing a password or other secure piece of information.
- #### pyperclip

- #### sys

- #### time
