# Unit 1 - Reflections:<br/>Programming in Python

Purpose of this page:

## Overall reaction to Python computing:

## Ah-ha moments (tricks for those who have coded in other languages):
- The colon is your friend
- Semi-colons at the end of sentences are overrated
- Indents are sensitive
	<br/>Don't panic when you get a compile error.  50% of the time it is an extra space after an indentation.
- Numeric commas can't be taken for granted
	<br/>Handling commas in number values
	<br/>print (format(42500, ",d"))
- "While True" is a nice automatic loop
	<br/>Simple way to stay in a loop until validation passes)
- Built-In modules are timesavers
	<br/>max(mylist, key=len)
- Quickly changing lists into strings and vice versa
	\The expression "".join(x)    Allows one to quickly turn a list "x" into a string
	\The expression x.split    Allows one to quickly turn a string "x" into a list

## Useful modules to import into code:
- random
	\For ability to randomly generate 1 or 0, which can be a yes/no 
	\Randomly generate...
- getpass
	\Extremely important to hide a user's input when they are typing a password or other secure piece of information.
- pyperclip
- sys
- time

## How my programs differ from other coders:

## Are these programs a reflection of my abilities?
